This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Contributing

### Developer Workflow
1. Create a new branch based off the `main` branch.
2. Once you are done with your changes, create a pull request to merge your branch into `main`.
3. In your PR, you will see a Vercel [deployment preview link](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments). Click on it to test your feature branch changes.
4. Once your changes are approved, merge your PR into `main`.
5. Test your changes on [staging](castello-di-pastine-inventory-git-main-jamshidghiasi-s-team.vercel.app) to ensure everything is working as expected after the merge.
6. Once your staging changes are approved, create a PR to merge `main` into `release`.
7. Test your changes on [production](castello-di-pastine-inventory-git-release-jamshidghiasi-s-team.vercel.app).
